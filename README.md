#### Autonomous Driving with Deep Learning Image Detector
*autonomous_driver_deep_learning.ipynb*

A self-driving algorithm for SuperTuxKart (racing game) that takes in snapshots of the racing environment, detects the objects around the player vehicle, and controls the vehicle in an hopefully optimal manner.

#### Image Caption Generator with LSTM Neural Network
*lstm_image_captioner.ipynb*

Trains a LSTM network that inputs an image and outputs a sequence of words.

#### Bayesian Modeling: Mixed Membership Model in Pyro
*mixed_membership_model.ipynb*

Implementation of the mix membership model in Pyro, an open-source probabilistic programming framework for bayesian models and variational inference.
