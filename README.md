#### Forecasting Cable TV Customer Acquisition
*customer_acquisition_forecast.pdf*

Used gamma-Weibull model to model customer acquisition at the population-level. Incorporated and estimated effects of external factors such as population growth and seasonal promotions.

#### Autonomous Driving with Deep Learning Image Detector
*autonomous_driver_deep_learning.ipynb*

A self-driving algorithm for SuperTuxKart (racing game) that takes in snapshots of the racing environment, detects the objects around the player vehicle, and controls the vehicle in an hopefully optimal manner.

#### Image Caption Generator with LSTM Neural Network
*lstm_image_captioner.ipynb*

Trains a LSTM network that inputs an image and outputs a sequence of words.

---

#### Bayesian Modeling: Mixed Membership Model in Pyro
*mixed_membership_model.ipynb*

Implementation of the mix membership model in Pyro, an open-source probabilistic programming framework for bayesian models and variational inference.

#### Experimental Design: optimal_control_group_selection
optimal_control_group_selection.ipynb

Created a greedy algorithm to select the best control group when conducting experiments with random-effect interventions.
